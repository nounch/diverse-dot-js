# diverse.js

`diverse.js` is a JavaScript scratchpad file.

## Usage

1. If a new idea hits the brain, a new section is added at the bottom of
   the file.
2. Copy-paste the code to the browser's JavaScript console to test it.

Pro tips:
  
- If you look for a past idea, just search the file.
- Concentrate on browser-side code (i.e. no Node-specific JS).
- Keep old ideas around.
